Somerset County Dispatch Twitter Bot
---

Note: Due to issues with the Twitter API pricing this is no longer functional. If things change in the I'll get this up and running again.

This is a pretty simple bot that works with the Somerset County API using [this wrapper](https://github.com/HelixSpiral/SomersetCountyAPIWrapper).

Currently live at [@SomersetLog](https://twitter.com/SomersetLog).
